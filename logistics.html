        <li>Participants, including staff and volunteers, are no longer requested to be vaccinated or tested.</li>
        <li>Wearing a mask is optional and will be based on individual comfort levels. Extra masks will be available at the registration desk, while quantities last.</li>
        <li>If anyone has been exposed to COVID-19 within 72 hours of coming to the meeting, they should wear a mask throughout the conference.</li>
        <li>If anyone tested positive for COVID-19 within 72 hours before coming to the meeting, they should come to the meeting only if they have been fever-free and have improved symptoms 24 hours before coming, and agree to wear a mask throughout the conference.</li>
        <li>If anyone tests positive for COVID-19 during the meeting and has a fever, they should isolate in their room until they are fever-free and have improved symptoms. They should also agree to wear a mask throughout the conference.</li>
